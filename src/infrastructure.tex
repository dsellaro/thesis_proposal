The research will be developed in the Laboratory of Applied Computing, under coordination of GCA, in Department of Exact Sciences and Engineering, Uniju\'{i} University. The laboratory is installed in a research room with approximately 45 $m^2$.

For tasks that require less processing power, such as: literature review, production of scientific articles, elaboration of algorithms and other artefacts of the research,  will be used a computer, which has the following configuration: operational system Microsoft Windows 10 Education, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5200U CPU, 2.20GHz; 2195 Mhz, 2 Cores(s), 4 logical processors, memory RAM of 4.00 GB.

The simulation of mathematical models and the high performance computational experimentations will to be carry out a server, which has the following configuration: storage SAS of 6 Gb, 12 units of 2U, two cache controllers of 4 GB; six discs of 2TB, 2.7 K rpm, NLSAS 12Gbps; our Intel Xeon E5-4610 v4 1.8GHz cache of 25M, QPI of 6.4 GT/s, without turbo, HT, ten cores/twenty segments; three SAS 2.5, 12Gbps 300GB disks; twenty four 16 GB RDIMM memory combs, 2400 MT/s; RAID5 with three to six discs; two redundant power supplies.

In addition, for both internal meetings and specialized seminars, the Postgraduate Program in Mathematical Modelling of UNIJUÍ University offers: eight classrooms equipped with projectors, six laboratories with a total of 150 computers, meeting and study rooms and auditorium.

As technical support, the postgraduate program has two secretaries and two computer technicians who are in charge of the management and maintenance of the laboratories. The library of UNIJUÍ has several materials, ranging from books, magazines, catalogues, technical projects, to articles, dissertations and doctoral thesis; and it has a set of reading rooms where access to the internet is allowed.
