Companies are taking advantage of cloud computing to improve their business processes. The cloud computing requires the interaction with many kinds of applications, so it is necessary to improve the performance of software tools that allow keeping information on all these applications consistent and synchronised. Integration platforms are specialised software tools that provide support to design, implement, run, and monitor integration solution. The runtime system is the part of the integration platform responsible for running integration solutions.
Integration platforms, available as iPaaS services, consist of the same platforms designed and implemented for use on on-premise applications, merely encapsulated with a web interface and a few new adapters for connecting applications to the cloud or with cloud services. Therefore, runtime systems need to be adapted to the context of cloud computing, mainly seeking an increase in its performance and an optimization of the consumption of computational resources. 
This proposal presents research problems of the doctoral thesis and how they will be addressed, in order to contribute to migrate and adapt integration technologies to the context of cloud computing.
